-- Task0.py
Time complexity - O(1) because input does not affect runtime

-- Task1.py
Time complexity - O(n) because two loops are iterated two both lists seperately i.e. O(2n) = O(n)

-- Task2.py
Time complexity - O(n) because list is iterated once.

-- Task3.py
Time complexity - O(n+log n) because for For loop and Python sort. 

-- Task4.py
Time complexity - O(n+log n) because for For loop and Python sort.
